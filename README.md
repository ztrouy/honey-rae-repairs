# Honey Rae's Repair Shop
A basic webpage built using React, in order to learn the basics of the React framework. 

In its current state, it is only able to perform a basic render of non-interactible customer tickets, and filter between showing all tickets, or only those that are marked as an emergency repair.

Below is the boilerplate README that was provided with the template that was used. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
